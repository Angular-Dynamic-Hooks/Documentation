# Angular Dynamic Hooks Documentation

This repository houses the landing page and documentation of the [Angular Dynamic Hooks website](https://angular-dynamic-hooks.com/).

It mostly consists of a Jekyll app that is automatically built via a custom Github Actions workflow and published to Github Pages when new commits are pushed.

Contributions and/or corrections via pull requests are welcome!
